title: 2021.12 v2.0
---

Both v1.15.1 and v2.0.0 were released this month. Breaking changes were introduced in the new major version, v2.x.

## v2.x Reminders

Before upgrading to v2.0.0, please be noted that methods like `logQueryError(err, sql, duration, options)` and `model.sync({ force | alter })` have changed, which has been noticed earlier in the [2021.11 release notes]({% post_url updates/2021-11-30-v1.15 %}))

### logQueryError()

           const table = Model ? Model.table : '';
```

This breaking change can be omitted if `logQueryError()` weren't used in existing code.

### model.sync()

```

The default is  `model.sync({ force: false, alter: false })`, hence `model.sync()` calls won't touch existing tables in v2.x, rather than switch to `ALTER TABLE` by default in v1.x. Please change from `model.sync()` to `model.sync({ alter: true })` if `ALTER TABLE` is still preferred.

It is highly NOT recommended using this method in production, especially not `model.sync({ force })`, which would `DROP TABLE IF EXISTS ...` to skip the hard work.

It is recommended using [Migrations]({% link migrations.md %}) to manage database.

## v1.15.1

### Model.join().limit()

[https://github.com/cyjake/leoric/pull/247](https://github.com/cyjake/leoric/pull/247)

In previous versions, following query:

```javascript
await Post.include('comments')
  .order('comments.id', 'desc')
  .order('posts.id', 'desc')
  .limit(1);
```

is equivalent to following SQL:

```sql
SELECT posts.*, comments.*
  FROM (SELECT * FROM posts ORDER BY id DESC)
    AS posts
  LEFT JOIN comments ON posts.id = comments.post_id
 ORDER BY comments.id desc
```

which is in order to guarantee that the first `Post` can be retrived correctly. But in actual scenarios, the ambiguity of this query makes this `ORDER BY` and `LIMIT` hoisting a premature optimization. For example, if the records of `Post` were like:

| post_id | comment_id |
| --- | --- |
| 1 | 3 |
| 2 | 2 |
| 3 | 1 |

the query should return `Post <#id 1>` but actually it returns `Post <#id 3>`. Hence this behavior is removed in v1.15.1.

### Date Casting

If the model didn't specify precision of DATETIME, the precision casting will be skipped in previous versions. In v1.15.1, the precision returned from `information_schema.columns` will be used. For example, in following model:

```javascript
class Post {
  static attributes = {
    createdAt: DATE
  }
}
```

the column type of `posts.created_at` might be DATETIME(0), which is the default in MySQL, or it could be TIMESTAMP(6) (recommended default by some DMS tools ). Since v1.15.1, these preferences will be recognized and added as complimentary metadata to `Post.attributes.createdAt`.

With the date precision complemented, following operations trigger date casting:

```javascript
const post = new Post({ createdAt: new Date() });
post.createdAt = new Date('2021-12-31');
const post2 = await Post.create({ createdAt: new Date('2021-12-31') });
```

There won't be much of casting work to do, besides following situations:

- If the column type is DATE(0), milliseconds will be omitted.
- If the column type if DATEONLY, hours, minutes, seconds, and milliseconds will be omitted.

### options.silent

When updating the `updatedAt` timestamp itself with `options.silent` set to `true`, there was this issue that the update won't take effect, which is fixed in both v1.15.1 and v2.0.0.

```javascript
const post = await Post.first;
await post.update({ updatedAt: new Date('2021-10-15') }, { silent: true });
```
