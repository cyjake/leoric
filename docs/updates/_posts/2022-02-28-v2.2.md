title: 2022.02 v2.2
---

In the past two months, whilst celebrating Chinese New Year, we have most of the available work force focused on enhancements about data types, validations, and compatibility issues about MySQL.

In February, we welcome two new contributors 👏👏 [@LB4027221](https://github.com/LB4027221) and [@luckydrq](https://github.com/luckydrq).

## Data Types Enhancements

### TINYINT、SMALLINT、etc.

More data types were added in v2.2.x, for example those specific numeric types in MySQL like TINYINT, SMALLINT, or MEDIUMINT. Those types are supported in SQLite allegedly as well, whilst in PostgreSQL only SMALLINT is available, we've got those edge cases covered in the correponding database drivers. Hence the types can be used universally:

```typescript
import { Bone, DataTypes } from 'leoric';

const { TINYINT, SMALLINT, BIGINT } = DataTypes;

export class User extends Bone {
  static attributes = {
    id: BIGINT,
    age: SMALLINT,
    sex: TINYINT(1),
  }
}
```

For those who prefer leaving the model attributes initialized with database metadata, the newly added data types will be recognized as well. For Example, if the DDL of `users` table is like below:

```sql
CREATE TABLE users (
  id BIGINT PRIMARY KEY,
  age SMALLINT DEFAULT 0 NOT NULL,
  sex TINYINT(1) NOT NULL,
);
```

The corresponding model attributes will be initialized by Leoric accordingly

```javascript
class User extends Bone {};
await connect({ database: 'foo', models: [ User ] });
assert.equal(User.attributes.sex.type.toSqlString(), 'TINYINT(1)');
```

## Validataions and Default Values

### Validations

[https://github.com/cyjake/leoric/pull/266](https://github.com/cyjake/leoric/pull/266)

| **DB/DataType (validate or not in SQL operations)** | **INTEGER** | **DATE** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| MySQL | 🔲query ✅insert | ✅query ✅insert |
| SQLlite | 🔲query 🔲insert | 🔲query 🔲insert |
| PostgresSQL | ✅query ✅insert | ✅query ✅insert |


We've enhanced the validation logics a lot in v2.0.2, most of the validations will be triggered in advance if the database used does so. For example, in MySQL all of the SQL below yield exception:

```sql
mysql> SELECT now() = '2022-13-12';
ERROR 1525 (HY000): Incorrect DATETIME value: '2022-13-12'
mysql> SELECT * FROM articles WHERE gmt_create >= '2022-13-12';
ERROR 1525 (HY000): Incorrect TIMESTAMP value: '2022-13-12'
mysql> INSERT INTO articles (gmt_create) VALUES ('2022-13-12');
ERROR 1292 (22007): Incorrect datetime value: '2022-13-12' for column 'gmt_create' at row 1
```

In v2.0.2 we will validate in advance to prevent the error query hit database.

### DEFAULT VALUE

In previous versions, when the models have `Model.attributes` left blank and have Leoric to initialize them accordingly, the default values won't be set. The advantage side of this behavior is that when generating INSERT or UPDATE queries, database can take of the default values handling, the disadvantage side is that when coming to scenarios like below:

```sql
CREATE TABLE users (
  id BIGINT PRIMARY KEY,
  level INTEGER DEFAULT VALUE 0 NOT NULL
);
```

and the User model has left `User.attributes` blank:

```javascript
class User extends Bone {}
const user = new User();
assert.equal(user.level, 0);  // user.level -> null
```

the newly instantiated `user` won't have `user.level` default to `0`, which is fixed in v2.0.4

## Fixed Issues

### UPDATE ... ORDER ... LIMIT

MySQL supports operations like`UPDATE ... ORDER ... LIMIT` or `DELETE ... ORDER ... LIMIT`, which is not fully supported in versions before Leoric v2.x, such as use cases like below:

```javascript
await User
  .where({ status: STATUS_BLOCKED })
  .update({ nickname: '*blocked*' })
  .order('id', 'desc')
  .limit(10);
// update the nickname of 10 users blocked recently
```

ORDER and LIMIT clause were omitted in previous versions, which is fixed in [v2.0.2](https://github.com/cyjake/leoric/releases/tag/v2.0.2); the DELETE equivalent is fixed in [v2.1.0](https://github.com/cyjake/leoric/releases/tag/v2.1.0). This feature is MySQL only, neither SQLite nor PostgreSQL supports it.

### ORDER BY alias

Ordering with alias column is fixed in v2.0.2

```javascript
await User.count().group('sex').having('count > 0').order('count', 'desc');
```

the Sequelize equivalent of the query above is like below:

```javascript
await User.find({
  attributes: sequelize.fn('COUNT', '*'),
  group: 'sex',
  having: {
    count: { $gt: 0 },
  },
  order: [[ 'count', 'desc' ]],
});
```

### UPSERT with createdAt DEFAULT

`createdAt` won't be set when UPSERT in previous versions. For example,

```javascript
Post.upsert({ title: 'yes' });
```

the SQL equivalent is like below:

```sql
INSERT INTO `posts`
  (`title`, `updated_at`)
VALUES
  ('yes', `CURRENTTIME`)
ON DUPLICATE KEY UPDATE
`title` = VALUES(`title`),
`updated_at` = VALUES(`updated_at`)
```

which left the `createdAt` attribute empty, and might cause the database to complain if `createdAt` can not be NULL. With the issue fixed in v2.1.1, Leoric can now generate correct SQL like below:

```sql
INSERT INTO `posts`
  (`title`, `created_at`, `updated_at`)
VALUES
  ('yes', `CURRENTTIME`, `CURRENTTIME`)
ON DUPLICATE KEY UPDATE
`title` = VALUES(`title`),
`updated_at` = VALUES(`updated_at`)
```

## Type Declarations

### Realm

The type declarations of `new Realm()`, `realm.connect()`, and `realm.define()` were added in v2.1.1 and v2.2.0, but there still might be some overlooked corners. We'd recommend taking [cnpm/cnpmcore](https://github.com/cnpm/cnpmcore) or [eggjs/egg-orm!examples/typescript](https://github.com/eggjs/egg-orm/tree/master/examples/typescript) as examples of writing Egg applications in TypeScript.

### [wip] Decorators

To better optimize the type declrations in models, we are experimenting TypeScript decorations. Here is what we've accomplished so far:

```typescript
import { DataTypes } from 'leoric';

const { MEDIUMINT } = DataTypes;

class Post extends Bone {
  @Column()
  id: bigint;

  @Column({ name: 'gmt_create' })
  createdAt: Date;

  @Column({ name: 'gmt_modified'})
  updatedAt: Date;

  @Column({ name: 'gmt_deleted' })
  deletedAt: Date;

  @Column(MEDIUMINT)
  wordCount: number;
}
```
