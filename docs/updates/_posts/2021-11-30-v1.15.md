## Timestamps

Leoric supports several timestamps:

- createdAt
- updatedAt
- deletedAt

Both `createdAt` and `updatedAt` are the widely received ones, which can be switched on in Sequelize with `Model.init(attributes, { timestamps: true })`. `deletedAt` is the one used to implement soft removal, which is automatically active if `deletedAt` presents.

In the November releases, timestamps in snake cases such as `created_at` and `updated_at` are recognized as well.

- fix: accept timestamps in snake case by [@cyjake](https://github.com/cyjake) in [#221](https://github.com/cyjake/leoric/pull/221)

## logQuery & logQueryError

Changes regarding query logging are as follow:

- feat: make duration in precise milliseconds by [@fengmk2](https://github.com/fengmk2) in [#236](https://github.com/cyjake/leoric/pull/236)
- fix: logger.logQuery should be guarded in case of error by [@SmartOrange](https://github.com/SmartOrange) in [#222](https://github.com/cyjake/leoric/pull/222)
- breaking: logQueryError(err, sql, duration, options) [@cyjake](https://github.com/cyjake) [#237](https://github.com/cyjake/leoric/pull/237)

In v1.15.x versions, `logQuery(sql, duration)` will return more precise `duration` values, which helps performance auditing.

The breaking change will be released in v2.x, which changed from `logQueryError(sql, err, duration, options)` to `logQueryError(err, sql, duration, options)`, by moving the `err` argument to a position that is more conventional in Node.js

## model.sync({ force | alter })

Another breaking change that is scheduled in v2.x is the argument defaults of `model.sync()`, which is default to `model.sync({ alter: true })` in v1.x

- If the corresponding table does not exist, `CREATE TABLE` it is
- If the corresponding table exists, will diff the table structures and apply the changes with `ALTER TABLE`
   - If the database is SQLite, due to the limited support of `ALTER TABLE` in SQLite, it is actually carried out by replacing the table with a newly created one with new structure and original records copied, which is possible to lose data if something went wrong.

Since v2.x, there will be three sync modes:

- `model.sync({ force })` always uses `DROP TABLE IF EXISTS ...` to clear existing tables, DO NOT use in production.
- `model.sync({ alter })` works the same as the v1.x `model.sync()`.
- `model.sync()` without `force` or `alter` uses `CREATE TABLE` to create missing tables and skips synchronizing models with existing tables.

Related changes are as below:

## WHERE clause in JOIN queries

执行联表查询时，条件过滤一般有如下几种情况：

When carrying out JOIN queries, the WHERE conditions might be one of the following three cases:

- The WHERE clause is to filter the join target table
- The WHERE caluse uses columns across tables to filter records in the join target table with columns on joined columns. Although if only columns from one of the tables are referenced, the query can still be optimized by introducing subquery.
- There is no WHERE clause

There was an optimization to hoist the columns in WHERE clause that belong to the join target table, and have them put in subquery, then JOIN other tables on the subquery itself. This optimization might (or might not) gets better query plan, but falls short when dealing with the second case in the list above.

For example, if `Post`s and `Comment`s were like:

```javascript
await Post.bulkCreate([
  { id: 2, title: 'Archbishop Lazarus' },
  { id: 3, title: 'Archangel Tyrael' },
]);

await Comment.bulkCreate([
  { articleId: 2, content: 'foo' },
  { articleId: 2, content: 'bar' },
  { articleId: 3, content: 'baz' },
]);
```

and the query condition was like below:

```javascript
await Post.include('comments').order('posts.id').where({
  'posts.title': { $like: 'Arch%' },
  'comments.content': 'baz',
});
```

the generated SQL will filter records of the target table in advance, which returns insufficient result.

```sql
   SELECT `posts`.*, `comments`.*
     FROM (
       SELECT *
         FROM `articles`
        WHERE `title` LIKE 'Arch%'
          AND `gmt_deleted` IS NULL
        LIMIT 1) AS `posts`
LEFT JOIN `comments` AS `comments`
       ON `posts`.`id` = `comments`.`article_id`
      AND `comments`.`gmt_deleted` IS NULL
    WHERE `comments`.`content` = 'baz'
```

Therefore this optimization is removed in this month, to make sure correct number of rows can be fetched in any of the cases listed above.

## TypeScript Declarations

A few issues about the `.d.ts` added in October were found when testing it in real battlefield such as [cnpm/cnpmcore](https://github.com/cnpm/cnpmcore), all of which has been persisted as test cases in test/types

- fix: return type of spell modifier methods & test cases [@小格鸡(alpa)](/alpa) [#238](https://github.com/cyjake/leoric/pull/238)
- fix: spell.increment() & spell.decrement() [@cyjake](https://github.com/cyjake)[#234](https://github.com/cyjake/leoric/pull/234)
- fix: bone.changed() return `false | string[]` type by [@fengmk2](https://github.com/fengmk2)[#231](https://github.com/cyjake/leoric/pull/231)
- fix: Literal should support bigint type by [@fengmk2](https://github.com/fengmk2) in [#226](https://github.com/cyjake/leoric/pull/226)
- fix: select((name: string) => boolean) by [@cyjake](https://github.com/cyjake) in [#227](https://github.com/cyjake/leoric/pull/227)
- fix: export { Collection } by [@cyjake](https://github.com/cyjake) in [#220](https://github.com/cyjake/leoric/pull/220)


There still are a few features unlisted in `.d.ts`, which should be complemented in December releases.

## Model.findOne()

When `Model.findOne()` is unable to retrieve any record from database, either `null` or `undefiend` could be returned. It is changed into a more consistent way by always returning `null` if nothing could be found.

- fix: findOne without result should return null [@JimmyDaddy(jimmydaddy)](/jimmydaddy) [#225](https://github.com/cyjake/leoric/pull/225)

## Model.bulkCreate([])

- fix: bulkCreate should adapting empty data input [@JimmyDaddy(jimmydaddy)](/jimmydaddy) [#232](https://github.com/cyjake/leoric/pull/232)
